                Dissection is a scientific technique involving the careful and
                systematic disassembling of a biological specimen to examine its
                internal structures. This method is commonly used in biology and
                anatomy education to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
                anatomy, morphology, and functions of living organisms.

                      Dissecting preserved frogs is a common way to learn about
                      the insides of animals and how their bodies work. It helps
                      us understand how animals adapted over time, like when
                      they moved from living in water to living on land.

                      Dissection allows students to see, touch, and explore the
                      various organs. Seeing organs and understanding how they
                      work within a single animal may strengthen students‚Äô
                      comprehension of biological systems.

                    Dissecting frogs in school helps students learn about animal
                    bodies by doing it themselves. This hands-on experience
                    makes it easier to understand how animals are built inside.
